I've moved to Okinawa JP from Tokyo JP due to private reason through Covid19 pandemic.
Looking for a remote position currently.
I can visit Tokyo occasionally when needed.

My current job is temporary one (till 2021 Nov) since I didn't have much time to find one when I moved to Okinawa, and I've been looking for a permanent one.
